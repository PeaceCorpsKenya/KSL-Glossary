Kenyan Sign Language digital glossary for Peace Corps Kenya


Imagine a widely used language

Background

The following is a project, started by Peace Corps Volunteers Rachel Rose and Peter Hess, who are currently serving in Kenya as 3rd year Volunteer Leaders. The focus of the project is an offline glossary of math and science terms for Kenyan Sign Language, which can be used by Deaf Education volunteers in country during traning and when teaching. There are currently around 500 signs, which were chosen by members of the Kenyan Deaf Community, and signed by our sign language trainers. The ultimate goal would be to be able to host the site as well, to provide access to the wider deaf community in Kenya. We also want to explore the addition of social features to expand the glossary, and enable discussion of the language by members of the Deaf Kenyan community. 

Project Goals

We want to create an easy-to-update site, where more signs can be added by people with limited technical skill, and to also incorporate a "discussion board" or similar system where video submissions can be incorporated, to create a social aspect where volunteers and community members can discuss signs/share videos and ideas/expand the knowledge available.
